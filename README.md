Loan Prediction Model
Overview
This repository contains a machine learning model for predicting loan approval based on applicant data.

Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model includes information such as:

Loan_ID
Gender
Married
Dependents
Education
Self_Employed
ApplicantIncome
CoapplicantIncome
LoanAmount
Loan_Amount_Term
Credit_History
Property_Area

Problem Statement
The goal is to predict whether a loan will be approved or not based on the applicant's information provided in the dataset.

Model Used
The model is built using Python and scikit-learn. Key steps include:

Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables.
Feature engineering: Transforming variables, scaling numerical features.
Model selection: Testing various classifiers such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests.
Model evaluation: Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess performance.
